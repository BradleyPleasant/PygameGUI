TODO:
Core Functionality:
[Done] - Rewrite core functionality to use ECS architecture.
[Done] - Implement a basic rendering system for UI elements.
[Done] - Create a basic event handling system for UI interactions.
[Done] - Optimize rendering pipeline for better performance.
[ ] - Optimize layout calculations to only recalculate when necessary. HARD
[Done] - Implement Vertical Layouts
[ ] - Implement Horizontal Layouts - Saving this for the last commit as it will require refactoring all of the core layout code
[Basically Done] - resizing should have no bounds but instead be bounded by the layout measure and arrange passes
    [Done] - resizing parents smaller than children preferred size should cause children to shrink accordingly
    [Mostly Done] - Needs work to make it global not local - Resizing should adhere with min/max sizes based on its neighbors preferred and min sizes to prevent overflow
[ ] - Add support for themes and styles to customize UI appearance.
[Done] - (done inside the layout's arrange method as it should) - Implement a third pass for Organizers so that children will grow to fill remaining space.
[In Progress] - Add custom Events for common interactions (e.g., onHover, onFocus, onBlur).
[Done] - Dabble with adding a input system for keyboard and mouse interactions.
[ ] - Add a camera system to allow for panning and zooming of the UI.
[ ] - rework the component and systems system to allow for better modularity and easier addition of new UI elements and features.
[ ] - Implement accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support).

Objects:
[Needs work] - Label - added padding - add alignment options (left, center, right)
[Needs Beautifying] - Button
[Needs Work] - Text Field (any one line input, return runs the onSubmit event)
[ ] - Integer Box (integer only input)
[ ] - Float Box (integer or float only input)
[ ] - Text Box (multi-line Label)
[ ] - Combo Box
[Done] - Draggable
[Needs a Renderer] - Resizeable
[ ] - Scrollable Area
[ ] - Image
[ ] - Checkbox
[ ] - Radio Button
[ ] - Slider
[ ] - Progress Bar


Notes:

[Done] Implement New Upwards and Downwards pass techniques for Organizers to better manage child element sizing and positioning.
